    <h3 class="tussentitel" style="text-align: left;">Introduction</h3>
    <p>My trainee report for the second week will be written in English, because it is part of my English assignment.
      Just like the first week,
      the second week was as busy as normal. But the tasks I performed were about the same as the first week. I had
      already learned most of the
      basics, I could work more on my own without needing a lot of help from my colleagues.
    </p>

  <div class="nieuws">
    <h3 class="tussentitel" style="text-align: left;">Day 6 (Monday 06/02/2023)</h3>
    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">The 6th day of my internship began very chaotic. I started with a phone call saying
      that a printer was on fire. I then had to
      go very quickly on site to disconnect all the other devices from the grid. Then I started checking all the devices
      for damage from the
      fire. There was a sticker printer that would no longer work on site. I took it to the office to test and there it
      did work. So it was a
      local error. I called technical services to fix the outlets there so the printer would work again. A little later
      I got a report of a
      kiosk that wouldn't work. The printer's blade was stuck so I fixed that. Then I fixed a computer with a black
      screen by opening it and
      replacing the faulty cable. Then it was afternoon and I went out to eat. After my break, there was a report that a
      printer had stopped
      working and paper was jammed. When I was on site I saw that it was a problem that the printer company would have
      to fix. I created a
      support ticket with them so it will be fixed. Then I fixed another emergency PC that kept getting stuck. And I
      took out some old laptops
      all the hardware so I could still use them. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="nieuws">
    <h3 class="tussentitel" style="text-align: left;">Day 7 (Tuesday 07/02/2023)</h3>
    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">The 7th day was a little more calm than the day before. I started by replacing the
      batteries from some PCs. This took quite some time because the PCs had 3 different batteries that needed to be
      taken out. Then there was another problem at the kiosks. With the vignette printer to be exact. It kept not giving
      tickets so I repaired the engine from in there and then it worked again. Then I had nothing more to do and started
      benchmarking the spare laptops. After that it was lunch time. After my break I started emptying a toner waste
      bottle from a very large printer. Then I repaired another kiosk id scanner and got the financial statements from
      the financial director. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="nieuws">
    <h3 class="tussentitel" style="text-align: left;">Day 8 (Wednesday 08/02/2023)</h3>
    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">Day 8 started with a very big task. There was a keyboard on floor 7 that no longer
      wanted to work and I had to go and look to place a new one. But when I placed the new one, it didn't work either.
      Me and a colleague spent a whole morning trying to solve the problem until we came to the conclusion that the PC
      had to be replaced. Then I placed another screen on the 3rd floor. Then I had an afternoon break. After the break,
      I started repairing the kiosks again. This time it was 2 valves and a blade that wouldn't work. After that, I
      repaired another computer mouse and looked a bit to arrange cable management in an office. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="nieuws">
    <h3 class="tussentitel" style="text-align: left;">Day 9 (Monday 09/02/2023)</h3>
    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">On day 9 I didn’t do anything because I was in the hospital with a concussion. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="nieuws">
    <h3 class="tussentitel" style="text-align: left;">Day 10 (Monday 10/02/2023)</h3>
    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">My last day was very calm. That’s always the case on Friday. I changed some battery’s
      from laptops and repaired some scanners. That’s how my day ended to.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="nieuws">
    <h3 class="tussentitel" style="text-align: left;">Conclusion</h3>
    <p>I really enjoyed my trainee period, because I really learned a lot about all kinds of computer skills like
      repairing old laptops or solving computer errors all around the hospital.
      The staff was very kind and helpful so I want to thank them for the really great time. I had lots of different
      jobs, from fixing computers to working on scanners. One thing I will remember is how to deploy a new computer to
      use in the hospital. I also learned how to repair different kinds of scanners because the scanners were the things
      that needed the most repairing. It was a process I have never seen before.
      During my trainee period I did a lot of different things, that was really great and as said before I learned a
      lot. Next year I want to study Software Engineering so this influenced my choice in a good way.
